The project allows a client to join a multicast group by sending a request to the server. The server then sends a list of stations and site information via TCP. The client selects a station to connect to and begins receiving live-streaming video from that station, regardless of whether other clients are connected. Stations continuously send data, similar to how TV/radio broadcasts even without an active receiver. The client can pause, resume, change stations, or disconnect via a GUI with thread handling
